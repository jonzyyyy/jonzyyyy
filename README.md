I'm currently a student at the National University of Singapore, pursuing a BSc in Computing, Computer Science, with a Minor in Quantitative Finance, expected to graduate in May 2027. 

I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and optimize processes by creating high-performance, scalable software. I enjoy collaborating with others who are as committed to continuous learning and applying it to build maintainable and well-architected applications.

I have practical experience in machine learning (ML) and full-stack development in Agile teams.

### üíª What I'm Currently Working On

I am currently a **Machine Learning Software Engineer Intern at Cynapse**, where I'm:
* Spearheading the development of a high-performance ML pipeline for large-scale vehicle object detection.
* Authoring modular Python scripts for feature engineering that reduced preprocessing time by 30% across over 40,000 images.
* Leveraging an open-source library (`cleanlab`) and an active learning loop to systematically find and correct label errors in the Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT), achieving a final object detection accuracy of 95%.
* Engineering a data-centric AI pipeline that employed Grounding DINO to automatically generate bounding box labels, streamlining the entire data preparation process.

### üöÄ My Projects

#### Wedding Planner App | *Software Engineer*
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Utilised a robust CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins, automating build, test, and deployment processes. This automation decreased deployment times by 50% and minimised integration issues, leading to more reliable releases.
* **Collaborative Development:** Established a forking workflow with feature branching and pull requests to manage collaborative development, maintaining high code quality and enabling rigorous peer reviews.
* **Software Design:** Applied object-oriented programming best practices and design principles (SOLID), resulting in a flexible and testable codebase that supported rapid iteration on new features.

#### StyleSwipe | *Machine Learning Engineer*
* **ML Pipeline:** Designed and developed a ML pipeline for an end-to-end image recommendation system by leveraging transfer learning on ResNet's CNN model to efficiently process a dataset of over 3,000 images.
* **Serverless Deployment:** Spearheaded the deployment of ML models using AWS Lambda and API Gateway within a serverless architecture and leveraging AWS EC2 for image feature extraction, cutting down response time to under 1 second.
* **Scalable Infrastructure:** Pioneered a scalable ML model deployment strategy by containerizing models with Docker and streamlining delivery via AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), enhancing efficiency and ensuring seamless production integration.

#### Traffic Police Driving Simulator Bot | *Software Developer*
* **Automation:** Automated the repetitive process of searching and booking driving slots, reducing waiting time from 3 months to under a week for 100+ customers by utilizing Selenium's Framework to navigate HTML pages.
