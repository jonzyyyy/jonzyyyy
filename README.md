I'm currently a student at the National University of Singapore, pursuing a BSc in Computing, Computer Science, with a Minor in Quantitative Finance, expected to graduate in May 2027. 

I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and optimize processes by creating high-performance, scalable software. I enjoy collaborating with others who are as committed to continuous learning and applying it to build maintainable and well-architected applications.

I have practical experience in machine learning (ML) and full-stack development in Agile teams.
